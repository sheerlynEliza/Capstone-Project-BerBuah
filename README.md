# Capstone-Project-BerBuah
**CAPSTONE PROJECT BANGKIT 2022** <br/>
In this project, we created a tensorflow model to classify fruit through image processing. We design with 7 classes of fruit, namely: Grapes, Dragon Fruit, Orange, Coconut, Pineapple, Papaya and Strawberry. With this project, we hope that it will be easier for us to recognize various kinds of fruit.

## Project Structure


## Dataset


## Network
In this model, we design using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, besides that we also augment our dataset by enlarging the image, cropping the image, and resizing the image. This augmentation process is expected to further train the model to learn the dataset. After successfully classifying the images, we save the results of the tensorflow model that we have designed in the form of Buah.h5. We also convert the model results to 6_Varians.tflite to simplify the process of making the application.
