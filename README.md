# Capstone-Project-BerBuah
CAPSTONE PROJECT BANGKIT 2022 <br/>
In this project, we created a tensorflow model to classify fruit through image processing. We design with 7 classes of fruit, namely: Grapes, Dragon Fruit, Orange, Coconut, Pineapple, Papaya and Strawberry. With this project, we hope that it will be easier for us to recognize various kinds of fruit.
